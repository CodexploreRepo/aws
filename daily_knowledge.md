### Data Lakehouse
- **Data LakeHouse** store the data in S3 (data lake) and use Redshift Serverless as a processing platform along with Redshift Spectrum instead of maintaining Redshift Cluster as a Data Warehouse since maintaining Redshift Cluster is quite expensive
### Concepts
- **Authentication** is the process of validating that a claimed identity is that identity.
- **Authorization** is the process of authorizing access to a resource based on a validated identity.
- **Data security** dictates how an organization should protect data to ensure that data is stored securely (such as in an encrypted state) and that access by unauthorized entities is prevented.
- **Data governance** is related to ensuring that only people that need access to specific datasets to perform their job is granted the access.
  - Governance also applies to ensuring that an organization only uses and processes data on individuals in approved ways and that organizations provide data disclosures as required by law.
