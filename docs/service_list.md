  - Storing and processing petabytes of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data
  - Support for ACID transactions (the ability to concurrently read, insert, update, and delete records in a dataset managed by the data lakehouse)
  - Low latency data access
  - Ability to consume data with a variety of tools, including SQL, Spark, machine learning frameworks, and business intelligence tools
