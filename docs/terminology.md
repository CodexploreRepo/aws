# Terminology
- **EDW** (Enterprise Data Warehouse) is the central data repository that contains structured, curated, consistent, and trusted data assets that are organized into a well-modeled schema
- **Governed table**: With governed tables, users can run transactional queries against data stored in the table, including inserts, updates, and deletes. In addition to this, with governed tables, users can time travel, which means they can query a table and specify a specific time, and the results that are returned will represent the data as it was at the specified point in time.
- **Massively Parallel Processing** (MPP) cloud data warehouses implement a distributed query processing architecture called (MPP) to accelerate queries on massive volumes of data. 
- **S3** Amazon Simple Storage Service
